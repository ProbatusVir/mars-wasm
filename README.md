Check out my project at https://wasm.joshuasmith.net

Or on my GitHub (if you're not already there): https://github.com/ProbatusVir/mars-wasm


This is just a project that I'm making to clear my head from my college Capstone!

While not much yet, I intend to make a fully-fledged IDE for WebAssembly, very similar to MARS MIPS, but for Wasm instead!
